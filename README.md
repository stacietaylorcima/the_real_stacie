# Stacie's Personal Website

I know what you're thinking: 
> Stace, why are you using a whole entire Next.js app for a single page of content and a silly little confetti animation? ðŸ¤¨

And to that I would say, I had big hopes and dreams for what I wanted to create over here. 

Alas, time and life in general are fleeting and it just is what it is, okay? 

Someday this will be more. Sometimes this is just a playground for me to test things out with very little overhead. And sometimes you just over commit. So, this is me over committing to what will someday be something great, but today is just... a page about Stacie. 

Cheers, friends! 


Oh, and if you wanna run this for some reason: 
```
yarn && yarn dev
```
