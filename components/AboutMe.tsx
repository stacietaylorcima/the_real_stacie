            Hiya, friend! I&#39;m Stacie. I&#39;m an engineer at Zapier, a
            nobody on Twitter, and the mom of two energetic kids who ask a lot
            of questions and have taught me a lot about empathy, patience, and
            unconditional love. I grew up in the midwest but am firmly rooted in
            California (physically and otherwise.)

            I know what working in a tech is like, and not just for engineers â€”
            I&#39;ve spent time in many corners of tech including support,
            product management, leadership, and more. These experiences made me
            deeply passionate about and committed to creating a more diverse and
            inclusive tech space for everyone.

            That&#39;s why I co-founded{" "}
            <a href="https://the-collab-lab.codes/">The Collab Lab</a>, a
            501(c)(3) nonprofit that helps recent bootcamp grads and self-taught
            developers learn the collaboration side of software development.
            Participants work on small teams to build a fully-functioning app in
            eight weeks, working alongside tech professionals and engineers who
            act as mentors. Since the inception, we&#39;ve onboarded more than
            140 developers, setting them up for success and supporting them in
            refining their collaboration skills on software development teams.

            I thrive in spaces where there is a lot of trust, and I work hard to
            build psychologically safe spaces that allow for high levels of
            trust in every space I venture into. I love contributing to the
            greater vision of organizations I work with, and am passionate about
            creating processes that help teams collaborate to achieve their
            shared vision.
