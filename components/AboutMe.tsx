              <Paragraph>
                Hiya, friend! I&#39;m Stacie (she/her). I&#39;m an engineering leader at Zapier, a
                nobody on Twitter, and the mom of two energetic kids who ask a
                lot of questions and have taught me a lot about empathy,
                patience, and unconditional love. I grew up in the midwest but
                am firmly rooted in California (physically and otherwise.)
              </Paragraph>
              <Paragraph>
                I know what working in a tech is like, and not just for
                engineers â€” I&#39;ve spent time in many corners of tech
                including support, product management, leadership, and more.
                These experiences made me deeply passionate about and committed
                to creating a more diverse and inclusive tech space for
                everyone.
              </Paragraph>
              <Paragraph>
                That&#39;s why I co-founded{" "}
                <a href="https://the-collab-lab.codes/">The Collab Lab</a>, a
                501(c)(3) nonprofit that helps recent bootcamp grads and
                self-taught developers learn the collaboration side of software
                development. Participants work on small teams to build a
                fully-functioning app in eight weeks, working alongside tech
                professionals and engineers who act as mentors. Since the
                inception, we&#39;ve onboarded more than 140 developers, setting
                them up for success and supporting them in refining their
                collaboration skills on software development teams.
              </Paragraph>
              <Paragraph>
                I thrive in spaces where there is a lot of trust, and I work
                hard to build psychologically safe spaces that allow for high
                levels of trust in every space I venture into. I love
                contributing to the greater vision of organizations I work with,
                and am passionate about creating processes that help teams
                collaborate to achieve their shared vision.
              </Paragraph>
              <Paragraph>
                I am absolutely driven by human connection and always eager to
                meet a new friend. Hit me up if you ever want to chat about
                leadership, diversity and inclusion, engineering, parenting,
                wine & cheese, or really anything femme.
